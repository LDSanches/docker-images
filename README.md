# JBoss Docker Images

Here we have some jboss docker images.
If you want to play, remember you have an order that you should follow before running each container (see below):

1. Apache

2. JON Server

3. EAP Domain and Host controller

## Build
You have to build each image. To do so, enter each directory and run build.sh.

Enjoy!
